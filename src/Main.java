            b) Bank management system:
            create a bank management system which has the following components:
            person (which saves first, middle and last name, age and a "social security number")
            bank (which saves a list of customers and their checking accounts, maximum overdraw amount)
            checking account (should have a current value, methods for taking and depositing money)
            opening a checking account should only work via a bank and must require a certain amount of initial deposit

            BONUS: make the banking system interactive
